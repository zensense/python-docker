## Gotta start somewhere...

* The Jupyter interface gives the user the power of CRUD
* It can create interactive hybrid documents using MarkDown and Python code blocks
* The code blocks are run synchronously, but can be run individually, too
* Other scripts can be used in the notebook directory by including them as packages in the notebook namespace

See [Jupyter docs](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) for getting started.
